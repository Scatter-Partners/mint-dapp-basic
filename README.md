# mint-dapp-basic

A bare bones self-hostable minting dapp for collections launched on Scatter.

You may need to update the ABI with you collection's current ABI. Scatter's contract versions change over time.

(you can fork these projects and customize to your needs as well just do not include any of the original images and theme colors / make your own to replace them)
